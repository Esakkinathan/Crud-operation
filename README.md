# Crud-operation
Hello
Its a CRUD opertion file,its stands for CREATION-READ-UPDATE-DELETE
I've done this with the help of python tkinter which is a GUI package for developing windows applications
Excel book is used to store data and for that I used openpyxl module.
Since its a login page,there is need to be a verification,I've included otp-verifiction for email address
So you can create,update,delete your profile
Thank you
